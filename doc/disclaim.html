 <head><title>The translation disclaimer</title></head>
 <body>

  <p>For most packages collaborating with the Translation Project, the
   translations should be disclaimed in writing by the translators, before
   being accepted for inclusion in the distribution.  There are forms that
   translators should fill once and send to the Free Software Foundation.

  <p>The Free Software Foundation acts like a kind of attorney that witnesses
   the disclaimer.  Some translators mis-read the translation disclaimer as
   assigning the translation works to the FSF, and are disturbed by this
   impression.  This is not really the case.  Once again, the FSF acts as a
   recipient and attorney for your papers, not as an assignee.</p>

  <p>The translator usually disclaims all translations he or she could produce
   for any package.  Yet, precisely, the need for disclaimers is decided on a
   per package basis.  When a maintainer asks for disclaimers, disclaimers are
   needed for all translations coming from any team for that package.  For GNU
   packages, maintainers do not really have a choice, as the GNU project
   requires disclaimers for almost all its packages.  For non-GNU packages,
   the choice is up to the package maintainer.  The safest for translators is
   to fill and return disclaimers, in this way, they put themselves free, once
   and for all, to work on all translations they will feel like, whether GNU
   or not.</p>

  <p>Unfilled forms are also available through the Web. Currently, only the
     plain text version is available; we hope to provide other formats soon:</p>

  <ul>
   <li><a href="../doc/DISCLAIM">Plain ASCII text</a>
  </ul>

  <p>The FSF noticed that the PDF version (and possibly others) of the
   translation disclaimer does not include the question at the bottom asking
   what team the person is translating for.  This is on the ASCII version, but
   not many people use that, apparently.  It would probably our jobs easier to
   make sure that all the versions included that part.  In the meantime,
   please make sure you write for which team you intend to translate.

  <p>Once you have the file, you should print it out on paper, fill it out and
   sign it with a pen, slip the results into a paper envelope, lick a stamp
   and send it by non-electronic mail, using the old slow way, to the address
   given in the form.  It may take many days for your envelope to reach the
   FSF's headquarters, and maybe two more weeks before your form is properly
   processed there.  You have to account for postal delays, but also for the
   fact postal mail is handled in bursts at the FSF, maybe twice per month.
   When the disclaimer is received by the FSF, a notification of receipt is
   sent by the FSF to the coordinator of the Translation Project, which in
   turn acknowledges the receipt by emailing to both the translator and
   his/her team.  One full month is not an overestimate, and you will be
   notified when processing of your disclaimer is complete.

  <p>File <a href="../registry/AUTHORS"><code>AUTHORS</code></a> holds a copy
   of all notifications received from the FSF.  The Translation Project robot
   does not read that information directly, however.  See the page for your
   own national team to see what the robot knows about you.</p>
