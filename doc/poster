[Update date, and list of teams.]

Free software is going international!  The Translation Project is a way
to get maintainers, translators, and users together, so that free software
will gradually become able to speak many languages.  A few packages already
provide translations of their messages by native speakers of the language.

For the Translation Project to be a success, we need interested people who
like their own language and write it well, and who are also able to work
with with other translators speaking the same language.  Each translation
team has its own mailing list, courtesy of Linux International.  You may
reach your translation team at the address `LL@li.org', replacing LL by
the two-letter ISO 639 code for your language.  Language codes are *not*
the same as the country codes given in ISO 3166.  The following translation
teams exist as of January 1996:

     Chinese `zh', Czech `cs', Danish `da', Dutch `nl', English `en',
     Esperanto `eo', Finnish `fi', French `fr', Irish `ga', German `de',
     Greek `el', Italian `it', Japanese `ja', Indonesian `in', Norwegian
     `no', Persian `fa', Polish `pl', Portuguese `pt', Russian `ru',
     Spanish `es', Swedish `sv', Telugu `te' and Turkish `tr'.

For example, you may reach the Chinese translation team by writing to
`zh@li.org'.

If you'd like to volunteer to translate messages, you should become a
member of the translation team for your own language.  The subscribing
address is not the same as the list itself, it has `-request' appended.
For example, Swedes can mail to `sv-request@li.org', with "subscribe"
in the body of the message.

Use your own language when writing to your translation team.  Keep in mind
that team members are expected to participate actively in translations.
If either your team does not exist yet and you want to start one, or if
you are unsure about what to do or how to get started, please write to
`translation@iro.umontreal.ca' to reach the coordinator for all translator
teams.
