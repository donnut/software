  <title>Welcome to the %(long_package_name)s site</title>

  <h3>What is the %(long_package_name)s?</h3>

  <p>The %(long_package_name)s (or TP for short) aims to get the maintainers
   of free software packages, benevolent translators (why not <em>you</em>!),
   and users all together, so that computers and systems (like Linux or GNU)
   gradually become able to speak many languages.  You may write to
   <a href="mailto:translation@iro.umontreal.ca">the TP coordinator</a>.</p>

  <p>You should find here various information about the %(long_package_name)s.
   This is still a young Web site, and text will be added according to the
   needs, as expressed by questions or comments from people.</p>

  <h3>Where to get information</h3>

  <!-- ABOUT-NLS is out of date / 2001-10-03 16:49:45 CEST -ke- -->
  <p>Recipes for using internationalized software, as a user, may vary from
   package to package, yet as a mere rule of thumb, the
   <a href="../ABOUT-NLS"><code>ABOUT-NLS</code> file</a> often applies.
   This file is also distributed within packages where it is meaningful.</p>

  <p>The pages for all the <a href="%(html_base)s/HTML/teams.html">Language
   teams</a> are listed separately; the team pages will offer contact
   information pointing to separate mailing lists and home pages.</p>

  <p>Most files of the %(long_package_name)s are available individually at
   various places in the hierarchy of the
   <a href=..>Central PO file registry</a> or nicely listed here by <a
   href="%(html_base)s/HTML/domains.html">Textual domains</a>.  There are
   European mirrors for this PO file registry:</p>

  <ul>
   <li><a href="ftp://ftp.unex.es/pub/gnu-i18n/po">ftp://ftp.unex.es</a></li>
   <!--li><a
   href="ftp://tiger.informatik.hu-berlin.de/pub/po">ftp://tiger.informatik.hu-berlin.de</a></li-->
  </ul>

  <h3>Software to use</h3>

  <p>If you are interested in discussions about translation related software
   consider to join the technical discussion list at <a
   href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/translation-i18n">http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/translation-i18n</a>
   resp. <a
   href="https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/translation-i18n">https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/translation-i18n</a>;
   there is also an email interface to subscribing/unsubscribing, write a
   message with a subject of "<code>help</code>" to <a
   href="mailto:translation-i18n-request@lists.sourceforge.net">translation-i18n-request@lists.sourceforge.net</a>.
   Problems localizing software packages, questions around the PO file format
   and tools helping the translator are on topic here.</p>

  <p>The %(long_package_name)s does a great use of
   <code>%(package_name)s</code>, yet this should not be seen as an absolute
   pre-requirement for maintainers.  The real goal is to favour the existence
   of translated programs, rather than being strict about a particular
   implementation of the translation mechanics.  Nevertheless, given the
   choice, you are invited to use <code>%(package_name)s</code>.  Version
   %(stable_version)s can be considered stable.  You may
   <a href="ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gettext/">download the latest copy</a>.
   Please use the official version 0.11 or better, if available (February
   2002).  Avoid any version before 0.10.39; these older versions produce PO
   files or PO Template files in a format
   which the Translation Project is not able to handle without human
   intervention.</p>

  <h3>Miscellaneous issues</h3>

  <p>The <a href=matrix.html>translation matrix</a> is updated from time to
  time, but should not be considered as a definitive reference.</p>
