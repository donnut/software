  <title>Welcome at the Translation Project</title>
 </head>
 <body>

  <p>The Translation Project (<b>TP</b> for short) aims to get maintainers
   and translators of free software packages together, so that most computer
   programs gradually become able to speak many languages.</p>
   
  <p>On these pages you find a
   <a href="pass/domains.html">list of packages</a> for which
   translations are handled by the Translation Project, and a
   <a href="pass/teams.html">list of teams</a> that handle the
   different languages.  Each team page offers contact information, pointing
   to mailing lists and home pages.</p>
   
  <p>There is an explanation of why translators
   <a href="whydisclaim.html">need to disclaim</a> the
   copyright on their translations (not assign it, just disclaim it),
   and an explanation of how to <a href="robot.html">deal with the robot</a>
   that handles the PO-file submissions.</p>
   
  <p>There are also detailed explanations for
   <a href="maintainers.html">package maintainers</a>, for
   <a href="leaders.html">team coordinators</a>, and for
   <a href="translators.html">individual tranlators</a>.
   If you still have any questions, you can write to
   <a href="mailto:coordinator@translationproject.org">the TP coordinator</a>.</p>

  <h3>Translation tools</h3>

  <p>The Translation Project makes a great deal of use of the package
   <tt><b>gettext</b></tt>, but this is not an absolute requirement for
   maintainers.  The real goal of this project is to encourage the existence of
   translated programs, not being strict about a particular implementation of
   the translation mechanics.  However, given the choice, you are invited
   to use <tt><b>gettext</b></tt>.  You can find the latest version of this
   package via <a href="http://www.gnu.org/order/ftp.html">GNU's mirror list</a>.
   Please don't use versions older than 0.11, as those produce PO and POT
   files in a format which the Translation Project is not able to handle
   automatically.</p>

  <p>To make translations, translators can make use of programs like
   <a href="http://kbabel.kde.org/">KBabel</a> or
   <a href="http://gtranslator.sourceforge.net/">gtranslators</a>. The
   <a href="software.html">Tools page</a> points to these
   and some others.</p>

<!--
  <p>Most files of the Translation Project are available individually at
   various places in the hierarchy of the
   <a href=..>Central PO file registry</a> or nicely listed by
   <a href="domains.html">Textual domains</a>.
-->

<!--There are European mirrors for this PO file registry:</p>
  <ul>
   <li><a href="ftp://ftp.unex.es/pub/gnu-i18n/po">ftp://ftp.unex.es</a></li>
   <li><a
   href="ftp://tiger.informatik.hu-berlin.de/pub/po">ftp://tiger.informatik.hu-berlin.de</a></li>
  </ul>
-->

  <h3>Discussion</h3>

  <p>If you are interested in discussions about translating and
   translation-related software, consider joining the technical discussion list at
   <a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/translation-i18n">
   http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/translation-i18n</a>.
   Problems with localizing software packages, questions about the PO-file format,
   and tools for helping the translator are on topic here.</p>
