Next:
* figure out if there are still any mirrors, and then what and how
  to mirror the new setup
* do the file searching for generating a domain page in a smarter way

Just before going live:
* run mirror_tp_data.py one last time, and clean up after it
* svn commit the changes to registry.sgml, then run 'make'
* remove the spurious site/latest/coreutils/messages.mo
* run calc-postats -uv  to make sure all POs are statted 
* run cv-symlinks.sh  to convert trans and teams to PO-files symlinks
* run po-tidy-links -n  to inspect state of links, then create missing ones
* run make-package-links.sh  to create a second hierarchy of symlinks
* run generate_pages -idt  to regenerate domain and team pages
* change the robot directive in layout.html.in to "index,follow"

Later:
* run 'make check' and delete PO files with fatal errors,
  at least the bad ones that are not the latest
* delete problematic zh_TW/xchat Big5 file
* search and delete problematic version numbers, like 0.5g not
  being recognized as older than 0.5.2; or improve the sort key
* search and delete the PO files with mistaken encoding specifications
* delete PO files for which translated strings are under 5%
* reject PO files for which translated strings are under 5%
* find out why there are no POT files for things like 'cook'
* simplify regex: filenames do not contain encoding any more
* add a page for retired translators
* make fileutils, sh-utils, and textutils not show up on team pages
* transform nano_1_0 back to plain nano
* walk through the packages to see if there are more recent versions;
  there is for lilypond, for example
* rename registry.dtd to tp-registry.dtd
* weed out double assignments from registry.sgml
* sort AUTHORS by data
* mail bug-tar about simpler fetch script
* check that 'Last-Translator' is the same as the _last_ line in the
  preheader, not the third line of that preheader
* translated_length and total_length seem only to get used in po-matrix;
  does it still make sense to produce these matrices?  as they are far
  too big to be comprehensible/overseeable
* change the robot text about the Subject line, so that it says that
  it's not necessary to mention the filenam and version of the submitted
  file when that file is in an attachment



==============================================
* Some old TODO from Montr√©al about the robot:

.* Site maintenance

. + Registry handling
.  - Cross-validate AUTHORS with the registry, once in a while.

. + Web aspects
.  - Do not list mailto for those not wanting them there.
.  - Reestablish mailtos for people having home Web pages.


.* Accepting submissions

. + Message format
.  - Accept PGP validation.
.  - Accept various end of line codings.

. + Authentification
.  - Meant for package maintainers submitting POT files, or URLs.
.  - Meant for team leaders altering the registry.
.  - Meant for translators to declare aliases, or envelope aliases.

. + Validation
.  - Try fuzzy matching on names and address, and diagnose matches.
.  - Ignore case within the domain.
.  - Have special envelope aliases to ignore.
.  - Record that the initial translator is different and do not complain.
.  - Process date intervals and precise packages for assignment validity.
.  - Reject a submission if PO-Revision-Date has not been modified since last.


.* Processing template files

. + Versioning
.  - Be uniform with the Web site about finding the best one.
.  - Allow some per-package specifities.
.  - Better documents problems for people wanting to lie:
.   : Maintainers wanting to use the version number of a future release
.   : Translators wanting to use the version number of a future release
.  - Branch processing.

. + When missing
.  - Attempt automatic download and extraction.
.  - Handle irregular archive names, not unpacking expectedly.
.  - Maybe check all URLs for when they change?

. + Further checks
.  - Do not msgmerge PO files if the POT file is not the latest.
.  - Refuse to upload a POT file we already have.
.  - Force Project-Id-Version when sending PO files to translators.

. + Maintainers should be able to handle POT files themselves
.  - Set the pretest URLs.
.  - Force POT file uploads.
.  - Process and announce.


.* Giving feedback

. + What to send?
.  - Redirection of rejects and difficulties directly to team leaders.
.  - No multiple successive messages announcing uploads to all members.
.  - Capability to send yet unmerged POT files to translators.

. + Overall format
.  - `formail -r' uses Sender instead of From.  Make this all more regular.
.  - Make sure all messages have a From indicating the robot.
.  - Ease Gnus threading for various log and debugging messages.
.  - Internationalisation of the full robot suite, itself.

. + Formatting details
.  - Tidy up processing of \007 and other control characters.
.  - Replace "probably someone is assigned" with registry information.
