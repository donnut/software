Next:
* when translator submits PO file that is not for the latest available
  POT version, then don't notify the maintainer
* if there is a PO  file for a more recent version of the package,
  do not change the symlink in the latest/ subdir
* add the version number to the mail sent to the maintainer, so she
  knows to what POT file the translators are reacting
* the robot should send reactions to submissions by a translator
  _not to the sending address, _not to the address in the PO header,
  but to the address officially registered in the sgml file.
* have the robot check the subject line with the actual contents
  of the email, or at least rewrite the subject line with the
  correct filename and version
* create a team-leaders mailing list at tp.org
* improve the color scheme: the middle ones are too dark;
  better would be: red-> pinkish -> grey -> softgreen -> green
* add color to the domain pages too
* figure out if there are still any mirrors, and then what and how
  to mirror the new setup

Just before going live:
* run mirror_tp_data.py one last time, the drop it
* change robot's directive in layout.html to "index,follow"
* convert trans and teams/PO symlinks to PO-files links,
  and remove the teams/ subdir

Later:
* run 'make check' and delete PO files with fatal errors,
  at least the bad ones that are not the latest
* delete problematic zh_TW/xchat Big5 file
* simplify regex: filenames do not contain encoding any more
* add a page for retired translators
* make fileutils, sh-utils, and textutils not show up on team pages
* transform nano_1_0 back to plain nano
* rename registry.dtd to tp-registry.dtd
* weed out double assignments from registry.sgml
* sort AUTHORS by data
* mail bug-tar about simpler fetch script
* search and delete the PO files with mistaken encoding specifications


==============================================
* Some old TODO from Montr√©al about the robot:

.* Site maintenance

. + Registry handling
.  - Cross-validate AUTHORS with the registry, once in a while.

. + Web aspects
.  - Do not list mailto for those not wanting them there.
.  - Reestablish mailtos for people having home Web pages.


.* Accepting submissions

. + Message format
.  - Accept PGP validation.
.  - Accept various end of line codings.

. + Authentification
.  - Meant for package maintainers submitting POT files, or URLs.
.  - Meant for team leaders altering the registry.
.  - Meant for translators to declare aliases, or envelope aliases.

. + Validation
.  - Try fuzzy matching on names and address, and diagnose matches.
.  - Ignore case within the domain.
.  - Have special envelope aliases to ignore.
.  - Record that the initial translator is different and do not complain.
.  - Process date intervals and precise packages for assignment validity.
.  - Reject a submission if PO-Revision-Date has not been modified since last.


.* Processing template files

. + Versioning
.  - Be uniform with the Web site about finding the best one.
.  - Allow some per-package specifities.
.  - Better documents problems for people wanting to lie:
.   : Maintainers wanting to use the version number of a future release
.   : Translators wanting to use the version number of a future release
.  - Branch processing.

. + When missing
.  - Attempt automatic download and extraction.
.  - Handle irregular archive names, not unpacking expectedly.
.  - Maybe check all URLs for when they change?

. + Further checks
.  - Do not msgmerge PO files if the POT file is not the latest.
.  - Refuse to upload a POT file we already have.
.  - Force Project-Id-Version when sending PO files to translators.

. + Maintainers should be able to handle POT files themselves
.  - Set the pretest URLs.
.  - Force POT file uploads.
.  - Process and announce.


.* Giving feedback

. + What to send?
.  - Redirection of rejects and difficulties directly to team leaders.
.  - No multiple successive messages announcing uploads to all members.
.  - Capability to send yet unmerged POT files to translators.

. + Overall format
.  - `formail -r' uses Sender instead of From.  Make this all more regular.
.  - Make sure all messages have a From indicating the robot.
.  - Ease Gnus threading for various log and debugging messages.
.  - Internationalisation of the full robot suite, itself.

. + Formatting details
.  - Tidy up processing of \007 and other control characters.
.  - Replace "probably someone is assigned" with registry information.
