Today:
* run 'po-tidy-links -n' to inspect the state of latest/ symlinks again

Soon:
* run 'make check' and delete PO files with fatal errors,
  at least the bad ones that are not the latest
* walk through the packages to see if there are more recent versions
* rename registry.dtd to tp-registry.dtd
* mail bug-tar about simpler fetch script

Later:
* search and delete the PO files with mistaken encoding specifications
* delete PO files for which translated strings are under 5%
* make robot reject PO files for which translated strings are under 5%
* simplify regex: filenames do not contain encoding any more
* add a page for retired translators
* should the robot really accept submissions for unassigned packages?
* improve 'po-tidy-links' to find all links that do not point
  to the latest available version
* make a reply for those who ask the robot for help
* add note that project was never called "FTP".



==============================================
* Some old TODO from Montr√©al about the robot:

.* Site maintenance

. + Registry handling
.  - Cross-validate AUTHORS with the registry, once in a while.

.* Accepting submissions

. + Message format
.  - Accept PGP validation.
.  - Accept various end of line codings.

. + Authentication
.  - Meant for package maintainers submitting POT files, or URLs.
.  - Meant for team leaders altering the registry.
.  - Meant for translators to declare aliases, or envelope aliases.

. + Validation
.  - Try fuzzy matching on names and address, and diagnose matches.
.  - Ignore case within the domain.
.  - Have special envelope aliases to ignore.
.  - Process date intervals and precise packages for assignment validity.


.* Processing template files

. + Versioning
.  - Be uniform with the Web site about finding the best one.
.  - Allow some per-package specifities.
.  - Better documents problems for people wanting to lie:
.   : Maintainers wanting to use the version number of a future release
.   : Translators wanting to use the version number of a future release
.  - Branch processing.

. + When missing
.  - Attempt automatic download and extraction.
.  - Handle irregular archive names, not unpacking expectedly.
.  - Maybe check all URLs for when they change?

. + Further checks
.  - Do not msgmerge PO files if the POT file is not the latest.
.  - Refuse to upload a POT file we already have.

. + Maintainers should be able to handle POT files themselves
.  - Set the pretest URLs.
.  - Force POT file uploads.
.  - Process and announce.


.* Giving feedback

. + Overall format
.  - `formail -r' uses Sender instead of From.  Make this all more regular.
.  - Make sure all messages have a From indicating the robot.
.  - Ease Gnus threading for various log and debugging messages.

. + Formatting details
.  - Tidy up processing of \007 and other control characters.
