* Translators' real names			-*- coding: emacs-mule -*-

This file is a holder for the correct spelling of non-English names, waiting
for the time we are ready to integrate the true writings in the registry.
ISO 8859-1 writings are not given, as we already have these correctly.

I rather hate to save Emacs internal codes within external files, but I'm
still lacking experience with such things.  Until I know better, this file
is kept in the `emacs-mule' coding system.  Suggestions heartedly welcome!
