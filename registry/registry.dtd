<!-- A textual `domain' is *not* the package name, yet they usually coincide.
     The `mailto' addresses point to the maintainers of the package holding
     this textual domain.

     The `ref' fields indicate FTP or Web sites for the textual domain.

     Each `keep' introduces version numbers.  PO files meant for kept
     versions are protected against PO file expiry.

     Each `ext' introduces a team code. External translations must not
     conflict with tp-maintained ones.

     The following flags are recognised for textual domains:
	`disclaim'	this domain requires translation disclaimers
	`autosend'	email new PO files to the package maintainer
-->

<!-- A `team' is named in English, and by an ISO 639 language `code'.
     It may have many `mailto', but only the first is handled right now.

     A mailing list for a team can be created at sourceforge.net.

     The `charset' is the one preferred in mail and PO files for
     that national team.

     A team often has a `leader', which is then our privileged contact for
     administrative purposes.  Add leaders to <team-leaders@translationproject.org>.

     The `ref' fields indicate FTP or Web sites for the national team.

<!-- A `translator' may have many `mailto' addresses, the first of which is
     canonical.  PO files may use any of those email addresses.

     The following flags are recognised for translators:
	`disclaimer'	the FSF acknowledged a translation disclaimer
	`autosend'	email the PO file from a new release

     Translators may translate any textual domain for which a translation
     disclaimer is not required.  For domains where a translation disclaimer
     is required, the translator should first have sent a translation
     disclaimer, the receipt of which has to be acknowledged by the FSF.

     The `do' clauses each tell one textual domain for which translations
     may be accepted directly, without going through the team or team leader.
     The team decides on the list of such `do' clauses for each translator.

     New translators should always be announced to their related national
     team, as this team should always stay informed of what is going on.
