  <title>Welcome to the Translation Project</title>
 </head>
 <body>

  <p>The Translation Project (<b>TP</b> for short) aims to get maintainers
   and translators of free software packages together, so that most computer
   programs gradually become able to speak many languages.</p>
   
  <p>On these pages you find a
   <a href="../domain/index.html">list of packages</a> for which
   translations are handled by the Translation Project, and a
   <a href="../team/index.html">list of teams</a> that handle the
   different languages.  Each team page offers contact information, pointing
   to mailing lists and home pages.</p>
   
  <p>There is an explanation of why translators
   <a href="whydisclaim.html">need to disclaim</a> the
   copyright on their translations (not assign it, just disclaim it),
   and an explanation of how to <a href="robot.html">deal with the robot</a>
   that handles the PO-file submissions.</p>
   
  <p>There are also detailed explanations for
   <a href="maintainers.html">package maintainers</a>, for
   <a href="leaders.html">team coordinators</a>, and for
   <a href="translators.html">individual translators</a>.
   If you still have any questions, you can write to the
   <a href="mailto:coordinator@translationproject.org">TP coordinators</a>.</p>

  <h3>Translation tools</h3>

  <p>The Translation Project only handles translations for packages that have
   been internationalized through the use of <tt><b>gettext</b></tt>.  See the
   <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/index.html">
   online manual</a> or run <tt><b>info&nbsp;gettext</b></tt> or your local
   machine for all the details about this package.  If it's not already
   installed on your machine, you can find the latest version via
   <a href="http://www.gnu.org/order/ftp.html">GNU's mirror list</a>.</p>

  <p>To make translations for packages that have been <i>gettextized</i>,
   translators can use just a simple editor, but programs like
   <a href="http://kbabel.kde.org/">KBabel</a> or
   <a href="http://www.poedit.net/">poEdit</a> make their work quite a bit
   easier.  The <a href="software.html">Tools page</a> lists these programs.</p>

  <h3>Discussion</h3>

  <p>If you are interested in discussions about translating and
   translation-related software, consider joining the technical discussion list at
   <a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/translation-i18n">
   http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/translation-i18n</a>.
   Problems with localizing software packages, questions about the PO-file
   format, and tools for helping the translator are on topic there.</p>
