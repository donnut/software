 <head><title>The translation disclaimer</title></head>
 <body>

  <p>For most packages that make use of the Translation Project, the
   copyright on the translations should be disclaimed by the translators
   before these translations are accepted for inclusion in the distributions.
   There is a form (see below) that translators should fill out and send to
   the Free Software Foundation (FSF).</p>

  <p>Some translators misread the translation disclaimer as an assignment
   of their translations to the FSF.  This is not the case.  The disclaimer
   merely says that the signer will never make use of the copyright on his
   or her translations: will never forbid copying them, and will never ask
   for some kind of compensation.  This guarantees that the FSF (and everyone
   else) will always be allowed to freely distribute these translations.  The
   FSF wishes to have this guarantee in writing, to be on the safe side.</p>

  <p>A translator usually disclaims all translations he or she could produce
   for any package.  Yet the need for disclaimers is decided on a per package
   basis.  When a package maintainer requires disclaimers, disclaimers are
   needed for that package for all translations coming from any team.  For GNU
   packages, maintainers do not really have a choice, as the GNU project
   requires disclaimers for almost all its packages.  For non-GNU packages,
   the choice is up to the package maintainer.  The safest for translators is
   to fill out and return disclaimers -- in this way they put themselves free,
   once and for all, to work on all translations they will feel like, whether
   GNU or not.</p>

  <p>An unfilled form is available here:</p>

  <ul>
   <li><a href="../disclaim.txt">Disclaimer (plain ASCII)</a>
  </ul>

  <p>Print the file out on paper, fill it out and sign it with a pen, slip the
   results into a paper envelope, lick a stamp and send it by non-electronic
   mail, using the old slow way, to the address given in the form -- or fax it
   to the given number.  It may take many days for your envelope to reach the
   FSF's headquarters, and maybe two more weeks before your form is properly
   processed there.  You have to account for postal delays, but also for the
   fact postal mail is handled in bursts at the FSF, maybe twice per month.
   When the disclaimer is received by the FSF, a notification of receipt is
   sent by the FSF to the coordinator of the Translation Project, which in
   turn acknowledges the receipt by emailing to both the translator and
   his/her team.  One full month is not an overestimate, and you will be
   notified when processing of your disclaimer is complete.</p>

  <p>A list of all translators for whom the FSF has received a signed
   disclaimer can be found on the <a href="authors.html">authors page</a>.</p>
