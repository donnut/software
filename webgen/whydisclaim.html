 <head><title>The translation disclaimer</title></head>
 <body>

  <p>For most packages that collaborate with the Translation Project, the
   translations should be disclaimed in writing by the translators before
   these translations are accepted for inclusion in the distributions.  There
   is a form (see below) that translators should fill out and send to the
   Free Software Foundation.

  <p>The Free Software Foundation acts like a kind of attorney that witnesses
   the disclaimer.  Some translators mis-read the translation disclaimer as
   assigning the translation works to the FSF, and are disturbed by this
   impression.  Such an assignment is not the case.  The FSF just acts as a
   recipient and attorney for your papers, not as an assignee.</p>

  <p>A translator usually disclaims all translations he or she could produce
   for any package.  Yet the need for disclaimers is decided on a per package
   basis.  When a package maintainer requires disclaimers, disclaimers are
   needed for that package for all translations coming from any team.  For GNU
   packages, maintainers do not really have a choice, as the GNU project
   requires disclaimers for almost all its packages.  For non-GNU packages,
   the choice is up to the package maintainer.  The safest for translators is
   to fill out and return disclaimers -- in this way they put themselves free,
   once and for all, to work on all translations they will feel like, whether
   GNU or not.</p>

  <p>An unfilled form is available here, currently only a plain text version:</p>

  <ul>
   <li><a href="../disclaim.txt">Disclaimer (plain ASCII)</a>
  </ul>

  <p>The FSF noticed that the PDF version (and possibly others) of the
   translation disclaimer did not include the question at the bottom asking
   which team the person is translating for.  This is on the ASCII version, but
   not many people use that, apparently.  It would probably make our jobs easier
   to make sure that all the versions included that part -- in the meantime,
   however, please make sure you write for which team you intend to translate.

  <p>Once you have the file, you should print it out on paper, fill it out and
   sign it with a pen, slip the results into a paper envelope, lick a stamp
   and send it by non-electronic mail, using the old slow way, to the address
   given in the form.  It may take many days for your envelope to reach the
   FSF's headquarters, and maybe two more weeks before your form is properly
   processed there.  You have to account for postal delays, but also for the
   fact postal mail is handled in bursts at the FSF, maybe twice per month.
   When the disclaimer is received by the FSF, a notification of receipt is
   sent by the FSF to the coordinator of the Translation Project, which in
   turn acknowledges the receipt by emailing to both the translator and
   his/her team.  One full month is not an overestimate, and you will be
   notified when processing of your disclaimer is complete.

  <p>The file <a href="../AUTHORS"><code>AUTHORS</code></a> holds a copy of
   all notifications received from the FSF.  The Translation Project robot
   does not read that information directly, however.  See the page for your
   own national team to see what the robot knows about you.</p>
