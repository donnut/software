* Notable Changes                             allout -*- outline -*-

During the move of the Translation Project from the University of 
Montr√©al to Vrijschrift in Amsterdam, several changes were made to the 
scripts that drive the robot and generate the web pages.  Below is a 
list of the most important ones.

.* Static HTML

Team and domain pages are now static HTML pages instead of getting 
produced on demand by a script.  This makes the pages load quicker,
gives them clean URLs, and finally gives the time stamp at the bottom 
some meaning: it is indeed the time the page was last updated.

.* Immediate updates

The PO-statistics (the "tranlated / total" numbers) are calculated the 
moment a PO file is added to the archives, instead of twice per day by a 
cron job.  The corresponding team and domain pages are regenerated 
immediately after that, so they show the correct numbers instantly, 
instead of half a day later.

.* Symlink updated correctly

The symlink in the `latest/' subdirectory is only updated when a 
translator submits a PO file for the *most* *recent* POT file of a 
package, not when a translation of an older version is submitted.  And 
only when the symlink is updated, the package maintainer is notified.  
This fixes a bug, as the maintainer should not get an email when a 
translator for some reason (maybe just to fix some glaring mistakes) 
updates an older version of the PO file, and most of all: the robot 
should not mistakenly indicate this older version as the most recent 
translation.

.* Differentiated mails

The mails that the robot sends to the team lists about new PO files are 
now differentiated: a translator-subimitted PO file is now announced 
differently from a completely new PO file (a PO file derived from a new 
POT file from upstream).

.* Better colours

The colour scheme on the team pages has changed so that all colours now 
have about the same brightness, instead of getting too dark around the 
50% mark.  Fully untranslated packages are now blue instead of red. And 
the domain pages are now coloured too.

.* Clearer structure

The structure of the site has been made clearer, several unneeded 
pages have been removed, others undusted and made more concise.
